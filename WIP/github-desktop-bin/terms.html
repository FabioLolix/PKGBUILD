    <h1 class="f00-light text-white text-center">GitHub Open Source Applications Terms and Conditions</h1>

    <p>
      These GitHub Open Source Applications Terms and Conditions
      ("Application Terms") are a legal agreement between you (either as
      an individual or on behalf of an entity) and GitHub, Inc. regarding
      your use of GitHub's applications, such as GitHub Desktop™ and
      associated documentation ("Software"). These Application Terms apply
      to the executable code version of the Software. Source code for the
      Software is available separately and free of charge under open
      source software license agreements. If you do not agree to all of
      the terms in these Application Terms, do not download, install, use,
      or copy the Software.
    </p>

    <h2 class="f2-light text-white">Connecting to GitHub</h2>

    <p>
      If you configure the Software to work with one or more accounts on
      the GitHub.com website or with an instance of GitHub Enterprise,
      your use of the Software will also be governed your applicable
      GitHub.com website Terms of Service and/or the license agreement
      applicable to your instance of GitHub Enterprise ("GitHub Terms").
    </p>

    <p>
      Any use of the Software that violates your applicable GitHub Terms
      will also be a violation of these Application Terms.
    </p>

    <h2 class="f2-light text-white">Open Source Licenses and Notices</h2>

    <p>
      The open source license for the Software is included in the "Open
      Source Notices" documentation that is included with the Software.
      That documentation also includes copies of all applicable open
      source licenses.
    </p>

    <p>
      To the extent the terms of the licenses applicable to open source
      components require GitHub to make an offer to provide source code in
      connection with the Software, such offer is hereby made, and you may
      exercise it by contacting GitHub: <a href="https://github.com/contact">
      https://github.com/contact</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Unless otherwise agreed to in writing with GitHub, your agreement
      with GitHub will always include, at a minimum, these Application
      Terms. Open source software licenses for the Software's source code
      constitute separate written agreements. To the limited extent that
      the open source software licenses expressly supersede these
      Application Terms, the open source licenses govern your agreement
      with GitHub for the use of the Software or specific included
      components of the Software.
    </p>

    <h2 class="f2-light text-white">GitHub's Logos</h2>

    <p>
      The license grant included with the Software is not for GitHub's
      trademarks, which include the Software logo designs. GitHub reserves
      all trademark and copyright rights in and to all GitHub trademarks.
      GitHub's logos include, for instance, the stylized designs that
      include "logo" in the file title in the "logos" folder.
    </p>

    <p>
      The names GitHub, GitHub Desktop, GitHub for Mac, GitHub for
      Windows, Atom, the Octocat, and related GitHub logos and/or stylized
      names are trademarks of GitHub. You agree not to display or use
      these trademarks in any manner without GitHub's prior, written
      permission, except as allowed by GitHub's Logos and Usage Policy: <a href="https://github.com/logos">https://github.com/logos</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="f2-light text-white">Privacy</h2>

    <p>
      The Software may collect personal information. You may control what
      information the Software collects in the settings panel. If the
      Software does collect personal information on GitHub's behalf,
      GitHub will process that information in accordance with the
      <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/github-privacy-statement/">GitHub Privacy Statement</a>.
    </p>

    <h2 class="f2-light text-white">Additional Services</h2>

    <h3 class="f3">Auto-Update Services</h3>

    <p>
      The Software may include an auto-update service ("Service"). If you
      choose to use the Service or you download Software that
      automatically enables the Service, GitHub will automatically update
      the Software when a new version is available.
    </p>

    <h3 class="f3">Disclaimers and Limitations of Liability</h3>

    <p>
      THE SERVICE IS PROVIDED ON AN "AS IS" BASIS, AND NO WARRANTY, EITHER
      EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, IS GIVEN. YOUR USE OF THE SERVICE IS AT YOUR
      SOLE RISK. GitHub does not warrant that (i) the Service will meet
      your specific requirements; (ii) the Service is fully compatible
      with any particular platform; (iii) your use of the Service will be
      uninterrupted, timely, secure, or error-free; (iv) the results that
      may be obtained from the use of the Service will be accurate or
      reliable; (v) the quality of any products, services, information, or
      other material purchased or obtained by you through the Service will
      meet your expectations; or (vi) any errors in the Service will be
      corrected.
    </p>

    <p>
      YOU EXPRESSLY UNDERSTAND AND AGREE THAT GITHUB SHALL NOT BE LIABLE
      FOR ANY DIRECT, INDIRECT, INCIDENTAL, SPECIAL, CONSEQUENTIAL OR
      EXEMPLARY DAMAGES, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO, DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF
      PROFITS, GOODWILL, USE, DATA OR OTHER INTANGIBLE LOSSES (EVEN IF
      GITHUB HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES) RELATED
      TO THE SERVICE, including, for example: (i) the use or the inability
      to use the Service; (ii) the cost of procurement of substitute goods
      and services resulting from any goods, data, information or services
      purchased or obtained or messages received or transactions entered
      into through or from the Service; (iii) unauthorized access to or
      alteration of your transmissions or data; (iv) statements or conduct
      of any third-party on the Service; (v) or any other matter relating
      to the Service.
    </p>

    <p>
      GitHub reserves the right at any time and from time to time to
      modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, the Service (or
      any part thereof) with or without notice. GitHub shall not be liable
      to you or to any third-party for any price change, suspension or
      discontinuance of the Service.
    </p>

    <h2 class="f2-light text-white">Miscellanea</h2>

    <ol>
      <li>
        No Waiver. The failure of GitHub to exercise or enforce any right
        or provision of these Application Terms shall not constitute a
        waiver of such right or provision.
      </li>

      <li>
        Entire Agreement. These Application Terms, together with any
        applicable Privacy Notices, constitutes the entire agreement
        between you and GitHub and governs your use of the Software,
        superseding any prior agreements between you and GitHub
        (including, but not limited to, any prior versions of the
        Application Terms).
      </li>

      <li>
        Governing Law. You agree that these Application Terms and your use
        of the Software are governed under California law and any dispute
        related to the Software must be brought in a tribunal of competent
        jurisdiction located in or near San Francisco, California.
      </li>

      <li>
        Third-Party Packages. The Software supports third-party "Packages"
        which may modify, add, remove, or alter the functionality of the
        Software. These Packages are not covered by these Application
        Terms and may include their own license which governs your use of
        that particular package.
      </li>

      <li>
        No Modifications; Complete Agreement. These Application Terms may
        only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized
        representative of GitHub, or by the posting by GitHub of a revised
        version. These Application Terms, together with any applicable
        Open Source Licenses and Notices and GitHub's Privacy Statement,
        represent the complete and exclusive statement of the agreement
        between you and us. These Application Terms supersede any proposal
        or prior agreement oral or written, and any other communications
        between you and GitHub relating to the subject matter of these
        terms.
      </li>
